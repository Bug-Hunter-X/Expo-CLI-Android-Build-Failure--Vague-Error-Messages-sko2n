# Expo CLI Android Build Failure: Vague Error Messages

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when building Android APKs using Expo CLI. The build process fails with vague error messages, typically related to `processDebugResources`. The underlying problem is often an incompatibility between the Android Gradle Plugin (AGP) version and Expo's requirements, or conflicts with other dependencies.

## Problem

The `build.gradle` file in this repository contains a configuration that will trigger the build failure.  The error message is typically not very helpful in pinpointing the exact cause.  This makes debugging difficult.

## Solution

The `build.gradle.fixed` file shows the corrected configuration.  Key changes might include updating the AGP version to one compatible with Expo, resolving dependency conflicts, or carefully reviewing any custom configurations within the `android` block.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Attempt to build the Android APK using `expo build:android`.  The build should fail with a vague error message.
3. Replace the `build.gradle` file with `build.gradle.fixed` and retry the build. The build should now succeed.
