The solution involves careful examination of your `build.gradle` (typically located in the `android/app` directory of your Expo project) file.  Common fixes include:

1. **Updating the AGP Version:** Ensure that the `com.android.tools.build:gradle` version in your `build.gradle` file is compatible with Expo.  Check the Expo documentation for the recommended AGP version. Update the `buildscript` block accordingly.
2. **Resolving Dependency Conflicts:**  Examine your dependencies. Conflicts between libraries can cause build failures. Use tools like `gradlew :app:dependencies` to analyze your dependencies and identify potential problems.
3. **Checking for Incorrect Configurations:**  Carefully review any custom configurations you've added to your `android` block in `build.gradle`.  Mistakes here can trigger build errors.  Double-check that plugins are correctly applied and options are set appropriately.

```gradle
apply plugin: 'com.android.application'

android {
    compileSdk 33
    defaultConfig {
        applicationId "com.example.myapp"
        minSdk 21
        targetSdk 33
        versionCode 1
        versionName "1.0"
    }
    buildTypes {
        release {
            minifyEnabled false
            proguardFiles getDefaultProguardFile('proguard-android-optimize.txt'), 'proguard-rules.pro'
        }
    }
    compileOptions {
        sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
        targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
    }
    // Corrected AGP version and dependency management
    // ...
}
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.example:some-library:1.0.0'
    // ...
} 
```
Always consult the official Expo documentation for the most up-to-date information on Android build configurations.
